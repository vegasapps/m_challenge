## Overview

Mordor Challenge for INFLUENTIAL Front-end Dev position )
by Rich Rubio.



## JS Framework

AngularJS with Greensock




## Challenges

First Barrier was setting up emacs with Haskell-mode which was unsuccessful after two days. Decided to find a way to show my skills in a challenge that was mainly Functional Programming. Created an page in html and angularjs that was intended to display the string outputs from the first, second and third divisor. But because I am not familiar with haskell and emacs, I was not able to complete.



## Installation

You the file index.html in any editor like brackets.io or sublime. 


## Final Notes

While I found the challenge out of my scope, I can walk away with a new experience particularly with emacs which I found to be a great editor, but just need more time to learn.


Thank you
